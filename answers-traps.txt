Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? 
answer: a0\a1\a2. a2 holds 13.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
answer: not found in asm code of main, might be optimized by compiler. compiler replaced f(8)+1 with 12 when compiling.


At what address is the function printf located?
answer: 0x630
  30:	00000097          	auipc	ra,0x0      # ra is pc(0x30)
  34:	600080e7          	jalr	1536(ra) # 630 <printf> = 0x30 + 0x600(1536)

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
answer: 0x38, after jalr executed, ra = pc + 4 = 0x34 + 4 = 0x38


Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? 
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? 
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
answer: output: HE110 World
        if it's big endian, i should be 0x726c6400, 57616 need not change.




In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
answer: 
output: x=3 y=1 (according to call.asm, y is equal to a2)
